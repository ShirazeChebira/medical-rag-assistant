For adults aged 60 years and older, treatment of hypertension should aim to lower systolic blood pressure to below 150 mmHg.

If tolerated, a target below 140 mmHg may be appropriate. 
Combination therapy may be necessary when monotherapy does not achieve target values.

First-line treatments include thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
